Organization of these files

The "doc_xx.hs" files are the java help configuration by language.

The "map_xx.jhm" files contain the configuration of the help tree in conjunction with the .\xx\contents.xml file .

The "search_lookup_xx" folder contains the keyword search base of the help.

(xx = abbreviated language (fr/en/it...)


The "icons" folder contains the icons for the doc

The folder "img-guide" contains the images of the guide without translation required

The "img-libs" folder contains the images of the library without translation needed.

The files of,el,en,fr,he,pt,ru,it,nl,ja,zh are the linguistic parts of the documentation 

In each of these linguistic files, we find : 
an "img-guide" folder containing the images of the library with the required translation.

An "html" folder containing the html documentation files for the language defined by the parent folder.

There are also two : 
contents.xml : is used by javahelp to build the guide tree
jindexer-stops.txt : this file specifies the words that should not be included in the full text search of the help.

To activate a language in the help, check the following points:
- In the file: \src\main\resources\resources\logisim\settings.properties 
               Check that the language abbreviation is present: currently (2023): de el en es fr pt ru it nl ja pl zh

               Let the key:  helpsetUrl=doc/doc_xx.hs ; where xx = the language abbreviation
 
 - In the path: \src\main\resources\doc
