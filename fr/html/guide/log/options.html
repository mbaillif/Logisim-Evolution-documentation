  // [ ] Stop-motion mode [ time_scale: 5ms ]
  //   [ ] Coarse-grained summary
  //     Data is captured only when all signals have stabilized, hiding any
  //     transient signal fluctuations that may happen during propagation.  Each
  //     captured value is recorded as if it were held stable for {5ms}.
  //   [ ] Fine-grained details  [ gate_delay: 10ns ]
  //     Data is captured whenever any signal value changes, including any
  //     transient signal fluctuations that may happen during propagation.
  //     Transient fluctuations are recorded as if the gate delay were {10ns},
  //     and stable signals are recorded as if they were held stable for {5ms}.
  // [ ] Real-time mode aka continuous [ time_scale: 5ms per second ]
  //   [ ] Coarse-grained summary
  //     Data is captured continuously, whenever the simulator is enabled.
  //     Transient signal fluctuations are ignored. Each second of real time is
  //     recorded as {5ms} of simulated circuit time.
  //   [ ] Fine-grained details
  //     Data is captured continuously, whenever the simulator is enabled.
  //     Transient signal fluctuations are captured. Each second of real time is
  //     recorded as {5ms} of simulated circuit time.
  // [ ] Clocked mode [ time_scale: 5ms per tick ] [ clock_cycle_length: 2 ticks ]
  //   [ ] Coarse-grained summary
  //     Data is captured at the end of each clock cycle (2 ticks), hiding any
  //     transient fluctuations that happen during the clock cycle.
  //     Each clock cycle is recorded as if it took {10ms} per cycle ({5ms} per tick).
